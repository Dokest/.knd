Pretext
title{Hello World!}
title{Title with a b{bold part}}


This is an example of multicomponent b,it{this text is both bold and italic}
You can also add images:
img{/images/logo.png}[center, width=400, height=400]

The idea is that you should also be able to write references as follows:
label{cite:test}"e=m*c^2"

At some other point I can reference that label using the ref component ref{cite:test}.

You should also be able to do tables using a custom syntax:
table{
	header{H1}
}[center]
